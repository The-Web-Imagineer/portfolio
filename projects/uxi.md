**UXinsight (UXI)** is a system that tracks & analyzes user experiences (UX), extracting ‚Äúunseen‚Äù insights from user behavior.

UXI started as an exploratory project into information visualization, however quickly spiraled into a much larger idea‚Äîevaluating and improving UX using AI (ie: predicting UX issues and improving interface design by modelling user behavior).
