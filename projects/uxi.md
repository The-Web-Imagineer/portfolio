**UXInsight (UXI)** started as an exploratory project into information visualization, however quickly spiraled into a much larger idea, now under heavy development on the way to an official, commercial release. UXI is a system that tracks & analyzes user experiences, extracting ‚Äúunseen‚Äù insights from user behavior from the manner in which they interact with an application.
