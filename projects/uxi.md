**UXInsight (UXI)** started as a final project for my _Information Visualization_ course at NYU, however quickly spiraled into a much larger idea, now under heavy development on the way to an official, commercial release. UXI is a system that tracks & analyzes user experiences, extracting “unseen” insights from user behavior from the manner in which they interact with an application.
