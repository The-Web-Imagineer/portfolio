**UXinsight (UXI)** is a system that tracks & analyzes user experiences (UX), extracting ‚Äúunseen‚Äù insights from user behavior from the manner in which they interact with an application.

UXI started as an exploratory project into information visualization, however quickly spiraled into a much larger idea‚ÄîUX evaluation and iteration using AI (ie: predicting UX issues and improving interface design by modelling user behavior). UXI is now under heavy development on the way to an official, commercial release.
