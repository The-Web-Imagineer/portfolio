I independently built Clevercat as the final project for my _Principles of Database Systems_ course at NYU, going beyond just the basic requirements and adding a variety of additional features including _user-session management_, SQLi mitigation, _search by scope & relevancy_, amongst many more.

The project objective entailed building a fully-functional, SQL-driven question-and-answer system which would allow users to perform actions such as posting questions under specific, hierarchical topics, answering posted questions, voting on answers, handling full-text search and more. I aimed to provide all of these features while also implementing a bunch of extra credit features (all of which are outlined in the full project report), along with designing a pleasant user interface with intuitive controls.

Check out the [full project report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zMaOHhK5QVISJhw-zEy4btloMn8hCeytYXa21A--pWg/edit?usp=sharing) for a more in-depth exploration of the features and design of the system.
