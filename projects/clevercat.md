I independently built **Clevercat** as the final project for my _Principles of Database Systems_ course at NYU, going beyond just the basic requirements and adding a variety of additional features including _user-session management_, _SQLi mitigation_, _search by scope & relevancy_, amongst many more.

The project objective entailed building a fully-functional, SQL-driven question-and-answer system which supported features including:

1. Posting questions under specific, hierarchical topics
2. Answering posted questions
3. Voting on answers
4. Full-text search (among others)

I developed all of the preceding, while also implementing a bunch of extra features (the details of which are outlined in the [full project report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zMaOHhK5QVISJhw-zEy4btloMn8hCeytYXa21A--pWg/edit?usp=sharing)), along with a pleasant user interface with intuitive controls.
