# Scoria

![scoria-screenshot](/assets/scoria-ss.png)

The concept for **Scoria** was a community-driven platform which uses live human input as well as Machine Learning to analyze users’ photos objectively — with the ultimate goal of helping them pick better profile photos. Users could vote on other users’ submissions while receiving feedback on their own. Machine Learning assisted in detecting patterns in image and voting data (ex: lighting, clarity, environment, facial geometry, voting trends).

The aim was to develop a tool to help people pick better photos for their online profiles — be it for social media, business/networking or dating. _First impressions matter_, and **your avatar is your advertisement of yourself** to the world. In an evermore digital world. A great avatar photo can be the deciding factor between a reply or a read receipt.
