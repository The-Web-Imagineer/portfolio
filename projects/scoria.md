A community-driven platform which uses live human input as well as Machine Learning to analyze users’ photos objectively, with the goal of helping them pick better profile photos. Users can vote on other users’ photos and get feedback on their own, ultimately receiving a composited rate on their own photo. Machine Learning assists in detecting patterns in processed image data (ex: lighting, clarity, environment, facial geometry, sentimental data, voting trends and more), weighed in along with real user votes.

The concept was a tool to help people pick better photos for their online profiles — be it for social media, business/networking or dating profiles. _First impressions matter_, and **your avatar is your advertisement of yourself** to the world. In an evermore digital world. A great avatar photo can be the deciding factor between a reply or a read receipt.
