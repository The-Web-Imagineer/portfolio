This was a fun little project to connect people by showing users how common most of the things they are embarrassed of or wary of talking about/admitting to actually are.

**Am I The Only One?** was a public poll for the internetâ€™s deep, weird, and otherwise 2am-_esque_ questions. Anonymously authenticates visitors in the background, skipping the need for manual account creation, allowing visitors to use the application instantly. Implements natural language processing to generalize user questions and provide statistics on polls.
