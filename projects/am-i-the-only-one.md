# Am I the only one?
(probably not)


This was a light-hearted, exploratory project to connect people by showing how common most of the things we are embarrassed of or wary of talking about/admitting to actually are.

**Am I The Only One?** is a public poll for the internetâ€™s deep, weird, and otherwise 2am-_esque_ questions, built in React. Anonymously authenticates visitors in the background allowing visitors to use the webapp instantly. Implements natural language processing for sentence generalization features and explaining poll statistics.
